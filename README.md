# WITMOTION MotionSensor Firmware
---
JY901 applications on
- ESP32 - WT32ETH01 model with ethernet

provided code for arduino IDE doesn't seem to work so wrote a whole new .ino code with MODBUS protocol
---
Communcation Protocol : UART RS485
---
compatible with Wit-motion devices working with RS485 

(WT901C485, HWT901C485,SINDT485 ... etc)

* change modbus protocol in the manual is wrong! double-check crc before uploading
